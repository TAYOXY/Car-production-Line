Implementing a stack using Java for a car production line

This project requires us to implement a stack using Java for a car production line. For this part of the assignment, I have created a Stack class and defined methods that are associated with Stack. I have also created a main() class to implement the stack.

Please note that for this program to run, you will need to install jeliot (link can be found below) and paste or open the code with it, then click the compile button.
